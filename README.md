## Install

``` sh
pip install assembly-ai-plus
```

## How to use

This Library provides a
[`AssemblyAI`](https://afizs.github.io/assembly-ai-plus/assemblyai.html#assemblyai)
class using which you can submit audio files for transcribing and
understanding.

``` python
from assembly_ai_plus.assemblyai import AssemblyAI
```

First create the assembly_ai instance by providing the AssemblyAI API
KEY, which you can get it for free from
[here](https://app.assemblyai.com/)

``` python
assembly_ai = AssemblyAI(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
```

### Submit the audio url for transcription

``` python
res = assembly_ai.submit_url_for_transcription(audio_url="https://bit.ly/3yxKEIY")
```

``` python
res.get('id') # This id is used to extract the actual text from the audio files.
```

    'rs3c8julbq-177d-4071-ab6f-d7c7a9bb6dbb'

### Getting the Transcription Result

``` python
full_details = assembly_ai.get_transcription_results('rs3c8julbq-177d-4071-ab6f-d7c7a9bb6dbb')
```

``` python
print(full_details['text'])
```
